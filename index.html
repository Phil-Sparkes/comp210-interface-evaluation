          <h1>Introduction</h1>
		  <p>This usability evaluation will be on testing the phone interface for the game: Standby.  <br />  
		  The phone is the main mechanic of the game and the way the player would interact with their surroundings. Research will be conducted to understand how well users reacted to the interface and how easy it was to understand.</p>

          <h1>Methods</h1>
		  <h2>Quantitative data</h2>
		  <p>For gathering quantitative data an online questionnaire was used and filled out by 20 different people. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions, with most of the questions having a scale from 1 to 10 on how often they used each different interface screen on the phone and how highly they would rate it. </p>
		  <br/>
		  <p>The online aspect of it means that anyone with a link would be able to answer the questions, this made it easier to gather results but also anonymised the data. The problems with using this method was that results could easily be forged, or duplicated. On the form there in an option to limit one response to an IP address but since the university system is all on the same address this would not work. </p> 
          <br/>
		  <p>About half the responses were obtained from other people on the course while the others were obtained through housemates and online friends. This lead to most of the responses being from mostly male avid game players from ages 19 to 23. This has biased the results but also could be considered useful because this is the target audience the game was marketed towards to begin with.

		  <br/>
		  <h2>Qualitative data</h2>
          <p>Two forms of qualitative data were collected, one through the form of an interview. The interview consisted of the player sitting down and playing the game for five minutes while being observed and then asked a series of questions with follow up questions. The interview was recorded using a phone so later it could be transcribed onto paper.  Five interviews were conducted, three being male and two being female. </p>
		  <br/>
          <p>The other form of qualitative data was gathered through observing what the players were doing while playing the game for instance what did they struggle with and what emotions did the game bring forth. The observations were made live while they played the game and gameplay was recorded so be watched back in case anything was missed.

		  <li>Tab key for menu was not intuitive, players would always go for the esc key and realise that didn’t work.</li>
		  <li>The objective menu doesn’t provide the player with much guidance, the players that took the time to read the objectives still went the wrong way.</li>
          <li>Some players found the game too scary and didn’t want to play it any more.</li>
		  <li>Many complaints about the flash light being too reflective on surfaces and blinding the player if they got too close to it.</li>
		  <li>Only one of the players managed to complete the first objective and obtain the first key.</li>
		  <li>Some people thought the black screen at the start of the game was a bug and it took a while before they realised that they needed to turn on the flashlight.</li>
		  <li>Many tried to activate lights and distractions while not on the activate screen.</li>
