          <h1>Introduction</h1>
		  <p>This usability evaluation will be on testing the phone interface for the game: Standby.  <br />  
		  The phone is the main mechanic of the game and the way the player would interact with their surroundings. Research will be conducted to understand how well users reacted to the interface and how easy it was to understand.</p>

		<section id="Methods">
          <h1>Methods</h1>
		  <h2>Quantitative data</h2>
		  <p>For gathering quantitative data an online questionnaire was used and filled out by 20 different players. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions, with most of the questions having a scale from 1 to 10 on how often they used each different interface screen on the phone and how highly they would rate it. </p>
		  <br/>
		  <p>The online aspect of it means that anyone with a link would be able to answer the questions, this made it easier to gather results but also anonymised the data. The problems with using this method was that results could easily be forged, or duplicated. On the form there in an option to limit one response to an IP address but since the university system is all on the same address this would not work. </p> 
          <br/>
		  <p>About half the responses were obtained from other people on the course while the others were obtained through housemates and online friends. This lead to most of the responses being from mostly male avid game players from ages 19 to 23. This has biased the results but also could be considered useful because this is the target audience the game was marketed towards to begin with.
          </p>

		  <p> The questionnaire used: </p>

		  <br />
		  <br/>
		  <h2>Qualitative data</h2>
          <p>Two forms of qualitative data were collected, one through the form of an interview. The interview consisted of the player sitting down and playing the game for five minutes while being observed and then asked a series of questions with follow up questions. The interview was recorded using a phone so later it could be transcribed onto paper.  Five interviews were conducted, three being male and two being female. </p>
		  <br/>
          <p>The other form of qualitative data was gathered through observing what the players were doing while playing the game for instance what did they struggle with and what emotions did the game bring forth. The observations were made live while they played the game and gameplay was recorded so be watched back in case anything was missed.

		<h1>Discussion</h1>
		<h2>Proposal - Players who read the controls would have a better understanding of the interface.</h2>
		<p>The questionnaire had twelve out of twenty saying that they did read the controls. The interviews had three out of five that read the controls. Using the quantitative data, a graph was made to see what effect this had on the players experience of the game.</p>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="785" height="558" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=1850349318&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p>This graph shows that reading the controls did influence two categories. “how easy it was to understand the phone interface” and “how often did you use the phone to activate distractions and lights on the map”. The ones who read the controls on average scored significantly higher on these two categories. Looking at the interview results the same results are seen, the three that read the controls were able to activate lights and distractions while out of the two that didn’t read the controls one said they didn’t know how to do it while the other managed to do it but wasn’t sure how they did. The observations showed the ones that had read the controls were much more confident with the phone interface. These results all show that the controls are useful for understanding and using the interface.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Proposal - Players who use the inventory menu more will also use the objectives menu more</h2>
		<p>The questionnaire results for players using objectives menu were higher than players using the inventory menu. Interviews and observations suggest that players looked at it once and then moved on apart from one who said, “I only used the objective menu and flashlight”. </p>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="480" height="288" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=1447134856&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p>This graph shows that there is a weak positive correlation in favour of this proposal. This shows that the players that used a certain screen on the phone interface would explore the other screens more, but overall usage of these screens was very little.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Proposal - Players who used the phone to activate objects on the map would also use the objectives and inventory menus more</h2>
		<p>This proposal assumes that players who are more comfortable with using the phone to activate objects in the map would also explore the different phone screens in greater detail.</p>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="588" height="288" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=1246864692&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<iframe width="480" height="288" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=75430998&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p>The results are too random to be able to draw a good correlation from. This suggests that being able to use one screen to activate objects in game does not affect the amount of time using other screens. Observations also showed this not to be true since most players just looked at the inventory and objectives screen once. During the interviews one player said that didn’t look at their inventory much because “it was already clear what was in my inventory”</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Proposal - Players who understood the interface would use the phone to interact with objects more.</h2>
		<p>If a player put that they understood the interface then they should understand the capabilities of the interface so expecting a strong correlation from these results.</p>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="480" height="288" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=1505590918&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p>This graph shows a correlation although it is not as strong as expected. This could be because players thought they understood the interface but didn’t understand all of it. If this question was later in the questionnaire or worded differently to be more concise maybe the results would have been different.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Proposal - Players who understood the interface would rate it higher</h2>
		<p>Those who felt like they understood the interface should find it more enjoyable than those who didn’t. Knowing the actions that can be performed using the phone and knowing the different screens should lead to a more enjoyable experience.</p>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="588" height="288" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTGSIBd3pL-Ku3DLIEqFnxMVHqV5wD03zJmMRP9BZU9ek_ZL1Qzu2G44ujjEQVXBTbQvN7bREyYaXkC/pubchart?oid=1700871709&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
        <p>A positive correlation can be seen in this graph but not as strong as expected. This could be due to other aspects of the interface such as the design or the features not being very enjoyable. If we analyse the results from one of the interviews, we get two contradicting statements. When asked how easy it was to understand the interface they replied, “Not that hard” but when asked how they would rate the phone interface they gave the answer “looks pretty good just hard to understand some screens”. This again suggests that they didn’t understand the question fully. Other interview results also talk about how the design of the interface when thinking about rating it rather than how easy it was to understand. “hard to read” being on issue that was raised a couple of times.</p>

		<section id="DesignChanges">
		<h1>Design Changes</h1>
		<p>In this section we look at the problems in the game and propose ways of combating these problems.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem - Players not reading controls</h2>
		<p>The fact that many players did not read the controls and then were confused in the game suggests that the controls should have been taught to the player through a different method. Looking at other games they have done this through tutorials or prompts on screen. Since the game is short and the player is in danger from the get go then the tutorial option would be better. Giving the player a room to use all the features of the phone with prompts telling the player what to do.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem – Aspects of the phone interface were hard to read</h2>
		<p>The text and other aspects of the phone interface were too small to read for some players. Redesigning the interface with making these bigger could work for this or having a button to bring the phone closer to the players face making it larger on the screen is another way.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem – Players did not use the objectives and inventory menus</h2>
		<p>Through observations it is clear that the objectives menu was not helpful to players. The objectives need to be refined to give the player a better understanding of what they need to achieve to make players use the menu. Players not using in inventory menu is not as big of a problem, due to players most players not making it far enough to pick up items they had no need for the menu. It is there just so players can check that they have got the item with them so doesn’t need to be changed.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem – No time to read the background story</h2>
		<p>The background story that appears at the start of the game goes by too fast. This should be changed so that the player has time to read it. This can be done by having it done on “press any key to continue”.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem – Players did not understand what objects on the map they could activate.</h2>
		<p>Giving the interactable map objects a glowing effect or outline when the player looks at them could make this clearer. This is done in games such as “Left 4 Dead 2” which highlights pickups such as pills and weapons.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Problem – Flashlight was blinding</h2>
		<p>The flashlight on the phone was too reflective on surfaces leading to players often being blinded, changing how the flashlight works in game would be able to stop this happening.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="Conclusion">
		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>
		The results gathered from this usability evaluation has provided information on what players did with the phone interface and how it can be improved. With this information the phone can be redesigned hopefully in a way in which it is more understandable and an overall better interface.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Collecting the data did prove to be a challenge especially in getting players of various experiences and backgrounds. Due to the small time frame we had to gather the players, the players that were got were not varied. The questions asked in the questionnaire also caused problems due to not being precise enough leading to different players interoperating the questions in unusual ways which then lead to not very definitive results. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Although the findings were influenced by these factors there was still valuable information extracted from the quantitative results. Through the interviews and observations some valuable qualitive data was also gained with the players managing to find bugs that have never been seen before. The feedback gave suggestions on how to improve the interface.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		After making some of the desired changes to the interface it would be beneficial to do another usability evaluation with better questions to see what affect the changes have made on how players play the game, and do they consider it an improvement. Using usability evaluations to gather feedback from people on game interfaces has proven to be a very valuable tool. During game development a lot of the things are overlooked, it’s not until external people get a hold of the game do these things come to light.
