          <h2><p>For gathering quantitative data an online questionnaire was used and filled out by 20 different people. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions, with most of the questions having a scale from 1 to 10 on how often they used each different interface screen on the phone and how highly they would rate it. </p>
		  <br />
		  <p>The online aspect of it means that anyone with a link would be able to answer the questions, this made it easier to gather results but also anonymised the data. The problems with using this method was that results could easily be forged, or duplicated. On the form there in an option to limit one response to an IP address but since the university system is all on the same address this would not work. </p> 
          <br />
		  <p>About half the responses were obtained from other people on the course while the others were obtained through housemates and online friends. This lead to most of the responses being from mostly male avid game players from ages 19 to 23. This has biased the results but also could be considered useful because this is the target audience the game was marketed towards to begin with.

          <h2><p> Two forms of qualitative data were collected, one through the form of an interview with people who have played the game and the other through observing what the players were doing while playing the game for instance what did they struggle with and what emotions did the game bring forth. </p>
		  <br />
          <p>The interviews had the player play the game for five minutes while being observed with the screen being recorded, then answering questions while having their voice recorded. After the interview the answers would be wrote down after listening back to the recording. </p>
		  <br />
          <p>The observations were made live while they played the game and gameplay was recorded so be watched back in case anything was missed.
